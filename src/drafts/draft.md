## How should women react when they hear sexist jokes? . 

It is nice to see that the world is showing some positive change. It is nice and to see that more women are getting into position of power and responsibility, but 
<br/>
It feels like those women have super powers. We must recognize them, their efforts and their success. I feel it is truly their personal success, not yet the one of our societies. They are not ordinary women, I feel they must be super talented or super dedicated or must have done a lot of sacrifices, or more likely, all of them.<br/>
What about the rest of us? Can we still succeed without super powers and without huge compromises, at the same level that men can?

Yes, in few companies. Too few. <br/>

I have a feeling that the ordinary life in many office environments, in many societies, is still very biased and favours men when it comes to career opportunites and advancement. It takes a way bigger effort for women to go far and we are more easily negatively judged than appreciated. So a mistake, a step in the false direction can cost us way more than to our collegues whereas a right move, an achievement will not take us as far.
I have seen very ordinary men in position of power, whose only merit was to have been in the right place at the right time with, not the right skills, but the right people pushing them up. I don't think I have ever seen a woman in a similar position without having really worked hard for it. <br/>

Part of the problem is that the different criteria are applied sometime consciously and deliberately, but most often, unconsciously. It is still engraved deep in our brains that women are better at certain things, and men at other. It is, whether we want to admit it or not, part of our cultural inheritage also in the most advanced societies. 
Until the attitude changes and both men and woman become aware of their biases and make a conscious effort to overcome them, we cannot even dream about having equal opportunities. 

So here I have a couple of stories.
I used to work for Swisscom. The company use to organize a bi-annual sport event open to all employees, they call it the Swisscom Olimpics, whereby people can go camping together in a nice location and they will challenge each-other in various sport activities and other learning experience opportunites. It is a great social event, apparently. 
<br/>
Now, I have two stories related to the time it was organized while I was working there. 
Team competitions were being organized and they were trying to balance the presence of man and women by giving more points to teams that were including women.
So I was invited to join one of the teams. It went like this: 

A group of (male) collegues approached me. 

He - _Hey Marzia, would you like to join our team? We need a girl._<br/>
Me - _Oh not sure I can help if you need a girl, but if you need a woman I might be interested_<br/>
He - _Oh I don't really care, we just need a vagina._ <br/>
Me - _emh then I'm afraid I won't really feel comfortable among so many dicks_<br/>

Well, I had to answer, I wasn't born in Buckingam Palace after all, but the fact is, nobody else in the group said anything. They just walked away.<br/>
As far as I know, they guy still works there and I believe he is advancing quite fast in his career.<br/>
And if you are wondering:<br/>
Did his manager know about this? Yes he did. <br/>
And did HR know about this? Yes they did <br/>
Did they take any action? No. At leat not that I know of. <br/>

(btw I am not 100% sure it was the same person, but a female collegue of mine in that team, confided that as she was squishing some stress ball she was approached and told "I see you girls like to play with balls")

The other story realated to the is this:
![Makeup course](/assets/swisscom.png)
Translated from Italian it means:
"A nice look will push your career opportunities to the stars. In this class our make-up artists will show you how to create a simple but effective make-up in little time. The magic formula is "do not overdo it": simple, multifunctional, essential - this is the makeup of a career-woman. And your next promotion will be ready at your fingertips."
<br/>
Of course, when I complained with HR about that, the description was changed completely within one minute and it even tried to appeal to men (go figure!).
<br/>

I am not really inclined to believe that in those two circumstances the bias was unconscious, but I wonder how is that possible that episodes like this are allowed to happen, let alone tolerated?

Until something like that even comes up on people's mind on people with high education degrees even, we as women, cannot be in a office and expect that we are taken as seriously as our male collegues.
