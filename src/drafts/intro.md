## A braind dump


Spending many years working in men dominated enviroments has definetely had a big impact in my career, but also on my personality.

I find myself very often imagining telling stories that happened to me, in the workplace expecially, and see the reactions, get some opinions. <br/>
In fact I have imagined myself doing that so often, that I have decided it's time to stop imagining and start dumping on screen the thoughts in my brain.</br>

I'm of course conscious of the fact that I cannot be unbiased, that I'll always be telling my side of the story, but I will try to be as factual as I can be.
