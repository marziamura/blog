When I moved to Switzerland from Ireland I didn't know what to expect.
I had been in the country just another time very briefly and I had no idea about the culture, the people and not even the beauty of its landscapes.

I had a cultural shock, having moved to the German speaking side, I had assumed the culture was close to the one of the neighbour country, but well, as whoever with a bit of experience with the country knows very well, I was wrong wrong. 

My husband and I decided to move to Switzerland to excape the windy and rainy Irish weather and to be closer to Italy. He was transferred with his company and we calculated that we could afford for me to be out of work while I was re-gaining the use of my German.
As it turned out, IT skills are very much in demand even here and I was able to find a job quite quickly.
I took a position as Scrum Master at Swisscom. There were very few women in my team, but I didn't even take notice, it has always been the norm in any other company I worked for.
The first anomaly I noticed was when a Meme was circulated to internally announced the launch of a new product.

While it is not particularly offending, it is sexiest. I did send a short notice to the person who had distributed it and he apologiezed.
