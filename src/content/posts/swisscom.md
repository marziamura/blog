## How should women react when they hear sexist jokes? . 

Gender and minorities inequalities are due to sterotypes.
Steretypes increase biases and biases lead to quick and poor judgement. 

Unfortunately some of them become so engrained in our brains, that even the people suffering from their consequeces may themselves being biased the same way, or even worse, they might come to accept certain behaviours as "just the way things are".

As I was working for Swisscom, I happened to witness or be subjected to several episodes of clear sexism. When I asked for support from my collegues I received answers like
"Oh come on, other women used to laugh along" or "I have only understood what you meant after I showed that meme to my wife", or from female collegues "yeah, not big deal, it is the way it is."

Some of the episodes might not have been such a big deal, but here I have a couple of stories I have decided to share, because the more I think about them (and it has been two years now) the more I think they should have not happened at all.

The company use to organize a bi-annual sport event open to all employees, they call it the Swisscom Olimpics, whereby people can go camping together in a nice location and they will challenge each-other in various sport activities and other learning experience opportunites. It is a great social event, apparently. 
<br/>
I have two stories related to the time it was organized while I was working there. 
Team competitions were being organized and the organization of the games was trying to balance the presence of men and women participating, by giving some sort of advantage to teams that were including women.
So I was invited to join one of the teams. It went like this: 

A group of (male) collegues approached me. 

He - _Hey Marzia, would you like to join our team? We need a girl._<br/>
Me - _Oh not sure I can help if you need a girl, but if you need a woman I might be interested_<br/>
He - _Oh I don't really care, we just need a vagina._ <br/>
Me - _emh then I'm afraid I won't really feel comfortable among so many dicks_<br/>

Well, I had to answer, I wasn't born in Buckingam Palace after all, but the fact is, nobody else in the group said anything. They just walked away.<br/> but as far as I know, they guy still works there and I believe he is advancing quite fast in his career.<br/>
And if you are wondering:<br/>
Did his manager know about this? Yes he did. <br/>
And did HR know about this? Yes they did <br/>
Did they take any action? No. At leat not that I know of. <br/>

(btw I am not 100% sure it was the same person, but a female collegue of mine in that team, confided that as she was squishing some stress ball she was approached and told "I see you girls like to play with balls")

The other story is all told by the following screenshot:

Translated from Italian it means:
"A nice look will push your career opportunities to the stars. In this class our make-up artists will show you how to create a simple but effective make-up in little time. The magic formula is "do not overdo it": simple, multifunctional, essential - this is the makeup of a career-woman. And your next promotion will be ready at your fingertips."
<br/>
Of course, when I complained with HR about that, the description was changed completely within one minute and it even tried to appeal to men (go figure!).
<br/>

I am not really inclined to believe that in those two circumstances the bias was unconscious, but I wonder how is that possible that episodes like this are allowed to happen, let alone tolerated?

Until something like that even comes up on people's mind on people with high education degrees even, we as women, cannot be in a office and expect that we are taken as seriously as our male collegues.
