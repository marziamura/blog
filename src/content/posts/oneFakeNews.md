As I was going through my morning fitness routine and listening, as I sometimes do, to the Italian broadcaster “Rai Radio 2”, I nearly fell off the elliptical machine as they announced:
## "Women that have more sex are smarter, study shows."

As it so happened, I had just read the articles they were referring to, and just before you get too excited, women, it did not say that. Not even remotely.
 
Truthfully, the radio program, <a href="https://www.raiplaysound.it/programmi/ilruggitodelconiglio">Il Ruggito Del Coniglio</a> (The Rabbit's Roar), is a humorous program, and the goal is not to disseminate scientific knowledge, but they passed on the news as something funny, letting the listeners believe that this was indeed the conclusion of the study.
So after taking a nice shower and walking the dog, and I have to admit it, before concentrating on my work, I turned to Google to look for the article. 
During the process, I discovered another piece <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/27/women-who-have-more-sex-have-better-developed-brains-study/"> on the New Your Post</a> that references the same scientific publication and claims that "women who have more sex, have a more developed brain".

It goes without saying that the scientists do not claim that either.


In reality, in the course of this study, researchers where able to locate the part of the brain called human female genital field, and show that it is more developed in women who have more sex. 
This is an extraordinary discover even without stretching it to include any other capacity of the brain.
<br/>
But media are competing for attention and an announcement that says that women who have more sex are smarter serve that purpose way better than stating that the “frequency of sexual intercourse within 12 months is correlated with structural thickness of the individually-mapped left genital field”.

If you have the time, you can read the article <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2021/12/09/JNEUROSCI.1081-21.2021">under this link</a>, but since I know that you probably don’t, I am reporting here some sentences from its abstract:

<p style="font-style:italic;">We provide a precise location of the human female genital field in the somatosensory cortex and, for the first time, provide evidence in support of structural variation of the human genital field in association with frequency of genital contact.[...] Our results pave the way for future research into the plasticity of the human genital cortex as a function of normal or adverse experience as well as changes in pathological conditions, i.e. sexual dysfunction, sexual deviation or sexual risk-taking behavior.(1)<p/>

And so women, please do not expect that having more sex will help you pass your exam in quantum physics, or any other complex stuff you are learning or dealing with right now... But hey! There are counteless other good reasons for it ;).

By the way, at Gilly, we have just launched a beta version of our app. There you will find a variety of scientific-based information and fun exercises that you can do by yourself or with your partner to help you discover more about your (and their) sexuality.
