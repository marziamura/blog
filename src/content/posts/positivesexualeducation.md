## Sex-posiive education and gender equality

Last year I started a new professional journey joining Erin Chen at Gilly (www.getgilly.com) as technical co-founder.

Gilly's mission is to improve the sexual life of couples who are really busy, expecially after they had children, and are struggling to find quality me/couple time. 
Erin and I met by pure chance, and until then I could have never ever imagined myself working in the sex-tech industry.

As the two of us started dating as business partners, I soon realized how important and impactful this topic is not just for couples but for every single human being and as far reached it is.

Disclaimer: the content of this blog post is not based on scientific evidence or research, it is based on my experience and my perceptions. 

The vast majority of people do not talk about sex. Let me be more specific, people do not talk positively about sex. Most of the language we hear in everyday life refferring to it, is negative, offensive, denigratory.
Negative sexual connotations are used to insult people, expecially women. 

So I wonder how much the gender inequality we experience in our lives, is rooted in the fact that the education on such a fondamental aspect of our lives is negleted and the void left by it is replaced by prejudice, non-biological based "explanations" of our anatomy and ultimately porn. 

I wonder, how many women or people in the LGTB community have been insulted on the road or even in the work place in the total indifference of people witnessing it.  How much has that impacted their self-confidence and their ability to express themselves freely?

It did happen to me, more than once, but here is maybe the worst that ever happened to me. 

The company I was working with, was organizing some big sport event that included team competitions. As it is often the case in IT, women were under represented and so the company was trying to encourage them partecipate by awarding some extra points to team who included them.
So I was approached by a group of colleagues:

He - _Hey Marzia, would you like to join our team? We need a girl._<br/>
Me - _Oh, not sure I can help if you need a girl, but if you need a woman I might be interested_<br/>
He - _I don't really care, we just need a vagina._<br/>
Me - _emh then I'm afraid I won't really feel comfortable among so many dicks_<br/>

Well, I had to answer, I wasn't born in Buckingam Palace after all, but the fact is, nobody else in the group said anything. They just walked away.<br/> 

I might have looked strong from my answer. But I was shaking. I still remember how I felt my heart pulsating and sense of humiliation for having been described as a part of my body in a way that didn't sound like a compliment at all.

Until something like that even comes up on people's mind on people with high education degrees even, we as women, cannot be in a office and expect that we are taken as seriously as our male collegues.
